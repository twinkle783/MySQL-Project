Restaurant 4324 in Downtown emerged as the most revenue-generating establishment. Overall,

type, average rating, seating capacity, meal price, number of social media followers
and marketing budget. All the factors are directly proportional to revenue of restaurant.
Most customers opted for french cuisine. Also the average rating , number of reviews
